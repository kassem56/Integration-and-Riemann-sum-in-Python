# Integration-and-Riemann-sum-in-Python


The main idea of this project is how we can apply both methods (definite integral and Riemann sum) on the computer. Letting the computer do all work for a definite integral by integrating the function and
compensating the interval inside the integrated function. Also for Riemann sum starts from
finding the requirements ( Δ𝑥, 𝑓(𝑎 + Δ𝑥𝑖) ) , solving step by step and finally drawing it on the
graph and partitioning the area under the graph for multiple partitions.
